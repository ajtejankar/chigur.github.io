The main objective of this blog is twofolds first, writing something down is a good way of solidifying my own knowledge and second, a different if not radically new prespective can always be of use to somebody.

Apart from above reasons there is another hidden motive, doing some creative writing. I had always thought I would grow up to be a writer but then things happened and I ended up becoming a programmer.
