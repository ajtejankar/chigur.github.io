Hi, my name is Ajinkya Tejankar and I am programmer based in Pune.
I enjoy programming, cinema, history and just about every other interesting thing.
The name *The Meditations* is inspired from the first ever [Zen Pencils comic][1] I read,
the above image is also from the same comic. You should definite checkout those comics,
they are a pure delight to read.
