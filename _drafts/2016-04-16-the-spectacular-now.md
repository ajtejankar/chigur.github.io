title: The Spectacular Now
---

Nuanced, simple, intricate, charming and naturally paced is how I would describe
the films that I was watching. And serene, awed and mature is how I feel after
watching them. I cherish good cinematic experiences and I will forever
treasure the memories of watching films like Lootera, The English Patient,
The Silver Linings Playbook and The Spectacular Now. All of these films are about
romance one of the most fundamental and easily understood emotion but
unlike a lot of films that treat such a complex emotion with distasteful
insensitity these films create an immersive environment for the viewer to
vicariosly experience it.

The Spectacular Now is a very good film indeed. Though I am quite skeptical
of rom-com films I was instantly hooked to the idea of a coming-of-age rom-com
made with deserving delicacy and boy does TSN deliver on the front of delicate
handling. After a long time I was rewatching scenes in a film just to catch
a clue that would help me make sense of the ending, it has been a long time
since Inception! I keep watching the final scene in the movie just to decipher
the emotions of Aimee, what does that restrained smile mean?. I am so rooting
for them to get back together they are so amazing together just like Aimee
explains her plans about marriage. They have some things in common and other
things not so common but which can make their life together so much fun and
this is where I disagree with a lot of what people have about the film
and its endings. First of all since I haven't read the book I don't care what happens to the
characters in it I am only concerned with the Sutter and Aimee as seen
and understood in the film. I cannot comment whether a film should
be judged within or without the context of the book on which it is based it
can be the subject of another blog post.

I read a comment on the internet saying Sutter was a bad thing for Aimee and
I partially disagree. Aimee is the paragon of sincerity but being sincere may not
get her the happiness she can have so she is not in the most optimal state she
can be in. Now, Sutter comes along moderately disturbs her world initially.
He promises to take her to prom and then avoids her but comes back to her and
is genuinely attracted towards her when he sees how mature and intelligent
she is. So far the disturbance that he has caused is mild in nature. They go
to prom and at this stage we see how engrossed they are in each other. Also,
Aimee seems to start drinking more frequently now which bumps up the readings
on disturbance-meter. What follows next is like a shock in the life of Sutter,
when his imaginary cool dad turns out to be a drunk and a jerk the very
likely outcomes of the choices Sutter seems to be making. How does this shock
affect Aimee, well Sutter hurts her real bad both physically and emotionally.
Now Aimee's reaction to this whole matter is the key thing to understanding
her overall character. There are two possible ways in which Aimee might reason
and be so eager to forgive Sutter. One, she is so enamored with Sutter and all
the attention she receives from him that she has deluded herself into thinking
that this was a mere accident not likely to repeat, a mere blemish in an otherwise
perfect love story. Second, she truly understands what she meant at the dinner
table about her plans of marriage, she understands how their relationship
is symbiotic in nature. Sutter brings in spontainity and she brings in maturity,
she understands the overreaction of Sutter, she understands that he is not
his father and truly believes their relationship can work. Now there is plenty
of evidence in the film supporting either paths of reasoning. She shows
real maturity during their lunch date, during the dinner, after the dinner and
her handling of her mother which supports the second outcome. On the other hand
it is quite uncommon to find such a highly mature 18 (or is it 17) year old girl
and everytime she sees Sutter you can't help but notice how love-struck her
gleeful laughter sounds like. There is one more piece missing to complete my
argument, is Sutter really like his father?. I definitely think not. There
is plenty of evidence at the end of the movie that shows how willing he is to
make changes in his life. So what really went on in Aimee's head? well I think
based on the evidence and general statistics of life Aimee was too much in love
to see the harm done to her by Sutter but I prefer a highly mature Aimee though quite
unlikely. I think in the end they get together with a more mature and better
understanding of their relationship. I don't mind tragedies but I don't like
ambigous endings. I can handle the ambigous ending of Inception it wasn't much
personal but this I can't tolerate, it is too much personal. Sutter and Aimee
together represent something that I would enjoy having but most likely won't
have but I have to be hopeful and fortunately the movie doesn't make it
a complete impossibility.
