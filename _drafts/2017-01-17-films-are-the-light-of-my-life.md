title: Films Are The Light Of My Life
---

Consider this line of thought: if experiences worth of an entire lifetime
are needed to make a man wise, and if we decide to watch a film of like it's
a life experience, then can a prolific film watcher acquire the experience
necessary to become wise? This is what I mean when I say that films are the
light of my life.

Our lives are mediocre. They are full of problems, failures, irritations
and sadness, but they also have the capacity to break out of this wretched
ugliness and rise to an ethereal level of simple, sublime, clear and elegant
beauty. A single man has the capacity to be a sadistic pervert and a caring
sensitive saint. I am these things myself. The dark imaginings in my head
are hard to reconcile with the thoughts of elegance that blossom from that
same shithole. But, films have helped in this process. Every time I watch
a film like Haramkhor which should upset me deeply, but it doesn't because
somehow it seems that I am capable of imagining those things without filling
myself with disgust, and this makes me confront the ugly cheap man within me.
Films are my concience. They expose a part of me that I abhor and help me
fight it. They are the mirror which clearly show me who I am, and one of the
things that a wise man has to see clearly is himself.
