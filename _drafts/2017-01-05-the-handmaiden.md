title: The Handmaiden
---

There is only one thing that I keep in mind when I am writing about or watching
a film: a movie is simply an experience. That's it. A great film can provide you
with a thrilling, dramatic or a sublime experience. The can experience can be
greatly disturbing or satisfying, but one thing is certain about any great film:
it delivers whatever experience it's designed for with maximum force. This makes
the whole process of reviewing highly relative to the reviewer. If he cannot
tolerate perversion, he won't find Oldboy anything worth talking about. To him
the all of the gore, voilence, and perversion is uncalled for in the plot being
conveyed by the film. But I am not one of those reveiwers rather I am not even
a reviwere, I simply enjoy films. I crave for challenging experiences. I like
dirty, perverted, voilent, passionate films because I have am all of them, and
yet I cannot watch a film that is banal, unintelligent, unoriginal, devoid of
any deap seated thought. No doubt that I am shitty little fuck but I'll be
damned if I can't think properly, and this reflects poignantly in taste in films.
And of the few films that reflect my personality so well, one of them has to be
The Handmaiden.

After watching The Handmaiden the name Park Chan-Wook is permanently added to
my list of favorite directors. A film that is sensual, sexual, perverse,
voilent, beautiful, and funny is a very nasty blend to get right. It's an
atypical romance drama that turns into a full fledged revenge thriller.
At every turn of the film you're left wondering about the it's trajectory: a
rare thing if you're a seasoned film lover like me. It's funny at places you'd
last expect and unapologetically intimate in others. People who don't like this
kind of stuff are liable to trash it as yet another on-screen sex glorifying
piece of crap being touted as art, but these people would be completely
ignoring the powerful feministic undertone of this film. It's as much about
breaking free as it's about sex and voilence. It's as liberating as it's
disturbing.

So, if you haven't watched it and you can digest all of the stuff I have mentioned
above, then you should definitely check out The Handmaiden.
